All credit for the game idea, art, and sounds goes to Ninja Kiwi. We simply
took what we observed while playing the game on our mobile device and
programmed it in our own private environment. The implementation is
uniquely ours. Credit for "Never Gonna Give You Up" goes to Rick Astley.
We did not make the song, although I wish we did because we'd be rich.

Bloons Tower Defense is a strategy game that aims to stop waves
of colorful balloons (called "bloons") from reaching the end of a winding
path. You do this by placing different types of towers along the sides of the path. Each tower automatically attacks any bloons that come into range,
using things like darts or bombs. You earn money by popping bloons,
which you can use to place more towers or upgrade the ones you have. The
game gets harder as more and tougher bloons appear, so you'll need to
think carefully about where to place your towers and how to build your
defenses. If too many bloons slip through,you loseâ€”so pop them all before it's too late!
